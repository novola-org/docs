## What is Novola?

Novola is a protocol that removes volatility from cryptocurrencies through various mechanisms, by calculating the arithmetic mean over a decade and using it as a basis for further pricing calculations.&#x20;

If the underlying asset has a positive price trend within a decade, then it is possible to make a volatility-free currency based on the past decade. This assumes that the underlying asset has existed long enough to collect enough market data needed for the calculations.

## Why Novola?

A volatility-free cryptocurrency lays the foundation for a global, decentralized future. The price will still increase using the price calculation formula, but the volatility will be removed in the process. This makes it a very safe investment for both small and large investors.&#x20;

The price can be easily predicted and calculated. There will be almost no reason to hold the original asset when instead you can have a safe one with no volatility at all.
